# TypeScript Todo App and Basics

Welcome to the TypeScript Todo App and Basics repository! This project is designed to provide you with a comprehensive learning experience for TypeScript. 
The repository consists of two main folders:

## Basics-ts

The `basics-ts` folder contains essential rules and methods for working with TypeScript without React. It serves as a foundation to help you understand
the fundamental concepts of TypeScript and how to apply them in non-React projects. Dive into this section to gain a solid understanding of static typing, 
interfaces, generics, and more.

## React-ts

Inside the `react-ts` folder, you will find a simple yet powerful ToDo App built using React and TypeScript.The app allows you to manage your daily tasks 
efficiently. It features an input field and a button that lets you add new todos. Additionally, you can delete individual todos by clicking on them. 
Experience the benefits of TypeScript in a real-world React application and witness how static typing can improve code quality and maintainability.

### ToDo App Features:
- User-friendly interface with seamless task management.
- Integration of React and TypeScript for enhanced developer productivity.
- Simple yet effective functionality to add and remove todos.
- A smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Introduction to Context API & TypeScript

As an added bonus, this repository includes an introduction to the Context API in the todos-context.tsx folder. Explore how to use the Context API with TypeScript,
enabling you to manage state more effectively in your React applications.

Whether you are a TypeScript beginner or looking to extend your knowledge of React and TypeScript, this repository has something valuable for you. 
Embrace the power of TypeScript, master the art of building ToDo Apps with React, and learn to leverage the Context API for more robust state management.

Feel free to explore each folder, read the documentation, and dive into the code to grasp the concepts better. Happy coding!
